# System Design Module - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview
The System Design module is a core sub-product of the Technical Interview Practice Platform. It provides a focused environment for senior software engineers to practice system design interview questions, receive AI-driven feedback, and track their progress.

## 2. Goals
- Enable users to practice real-world system design problems in an interactive, interview-like environment.
- Provide actionable, AI-generated feedback and scoring on user solutions.
- Support both textual/code-based and visual (whiteboard) design workflows.
- Track user progress and highlight areas for improvement.

## 3. Target Audience
- Senior software engineers and above preparing for technical interviews.
- Users seeking to improve their system design skills and receive structured, automated feedback.

## 4. Core Features

### 4.1 Problem Presentation
- Display a system design problem statement prominently.
- Show a checklist of requirements (e.g., Thread-safe, Efficient, Scalable) for the user to address.
- Allow users to mark requirements as they address them.

### 4.2 Solution Workspace
- **Tabbed Interface:**  
  - **Editor Tab:**  
    - Rich text/code editor for users to write their design, pseudocode, or implementation details.
    - Syntax highlighting and basic formatting.
    - Placeholder text to guide users (“Start designing your system here...”).
  - **Whiteboard Tab:**  
    - Interactive whiteboard for drawing architecture diagrams.
    - Support for basic shapes, connectors, and text annotations.
    - Ability to switch between Editor and Whiteboard seamlessly.

### 4.3 AI Evaluation & Feedback
- **AI Scoring Panel:**  
  - Display scores for key dimensions (Correctness, Efficiency, Scalability).
  - Show progress bars and percentage scores for each dimension.
  - Provide concise explanations for each score.
- **AI Feedback Section:**  
  - List actionable feedback items, each with an icon indicating type (info, warning, suggestion).
  - Feedback should be specific, e.g., “Good use of a sliding window algorithm for rate limiting.”
  - Highlight areas for improvement and alternative approaches.

### 4.4 Submission & Iteration
- Prominent "Submit" button to trigger AI evaluation.
- Allow users to iterate on their solution and resubmit for updated feedback.
- Save user progress automatically.

### 4.5 Navigation & User Experience
- Top navigation bar with links to Problems, Explore, Interview Prep, and user profile.
- Clean, modern, and distraction-free UI.
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet.

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1 Frontend
- React-based SPA.
- Monaco Editor (or similar) for code/text editing.
- Custom or third-party whiteboard component.
- Real-time updates for collaborative features (future consideration).
- Accessible and responsive design.

### 5.2 Backend
- FastAPI for API endpoints.
- LangChain for AI evaluation and feedback generation.
- PostgreSQL for storing problems, user solutions, and feedback.
- WebSocket support for real-time features (future).

### 5.3 AI Integration
- Use LangChain to analyze user solutions and generate:
  - Scores for correctness, efficiency, scalability.
  - Explanations and actionable feedback.
- Support for both text/code and diagram input evaluation (diagram evaluation: future consideration).

### 5.4 Security
- User authentication and authorization.
- Secure storage of user submissions and feedback.
- Input validation and sanitization.

## 6. Admin Features (for System Design Module)
- Admin interface to add, edit, and categorize system design problems.
- Manage requirements checklist and reference solutions.
- Review and moderate user submissions and feedback quality.

## 7. Success Metrics
- Number of problems attempted and completed.
- User engagement with feedback and iteration.
- Improvement in user scores over time.
- User satisfaction with AI feedback.

## 8. Future Considerations
- Real-time collaborative design sessions.
- Peer review and discussion features.
- Advanced diagram evaluation.
- Integration with behavioral module for full interview simulation.
